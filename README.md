<h1>Odin Landing Page</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The website will consist in a landing page inspired on popular streaming platforms, with the focus on animes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>On this project, I'll be making a simply layout design for a anime website, inspired on popular streaming platforms. This page was created from scratch by me based on current classes from The Odin Project. Here I'll be putting in practice flexbox concepts and other cool things!</p>
<h2>What I learned on the project:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to use Flexbox.</li>
<li>Some concepts of building layouts, and start thinking about responsive layouts for the web.</li>
<li>How to create and modify scrollbars.</li>
<li>Writing more consistent and clean HTML/CSS coding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I had difficulty on the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>I had some problems with Overflowing content over the page.</li>
<li>In order to make the page responsive, I had to deal on how to make the content fit the way I wanted to on a small screen. I had some headaches, but I finished with the design I wanted to.</li>
<li>By learning Flexbox, I feel like I could do every layout on the web, but that wasn't right of course, but the main problem was that I noticed that I didn't know how to structure the content on the page (building layouts). So I'm going to use this spot as a room to improve in future.</li>
</ul>
